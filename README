	- basic configuration
* provides easy control over these applications from either a CLI pseudo-terminal or the PieHelper menu
	- stop
	- start

	- switching from one application to another
* the current list of supported applications is 
	- Kodi
	- Moonlight
	- RetroPie/Emulationstation
	- X11

	- PieHelper

 PieHelper has been written entirely in ksh and currently has no prerequisites
except for it's assumption of systemd as a service managament facility and
either apt or pacman for package management. It *SHOULD* therefore work out of
the box on Raspbian, Noobs, Ubuntu and ArchLinux distros. Currently however,
it has only been extensively tested on Archlinux, Raspbian and therefore Noobs.
OSMC support is not implemented yet but planned
