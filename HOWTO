- PieHelper works by binding a supported application to a specific TTY
  When switching to a TTY, the application bound to it will autostart
- PieHelper will autodetect a first run and start configure mode
  Alternatively, running confpieh_ph.sh -c will also start configuration for PieHelper
  PieHelper will configure it's menu as the default app to start on system boot during this initial configuration
- During initial configuration, the location for all CLI tools will be automatically added to your PATH variable
  The PieHelper menu or any available tools can be used to manage applications integrated by default or
  to install and integrate or to remove any additional out-of-scope applications (applications not integrated by default)
- List of available CLI tools :

	* confpieh_ph.sh : used to - Configure PieHelper
				   - Unconfigure PieHelper
				   - Uninstall PieHelper
				   - Check for broken PieHelper TTY configurations and attempt a repair where needed
				   - Display the current state and version of PieHelper
				   - List all available PieHelper modules relevant to your OS and their current debugstate 
				   - Toggle the debugstate of any relevant PieHelper modules
	* confapps_ph.sh : used to - List all applications currently integrated with PieHelper
				   - List all applications currently supported by PieHelper
				   - List the application currently configured as the application to start by default on system boot
				   - List any integrated applications currently running
				   - List all of the above
				   - List all supported applications and their allocated TTY
				   - Install and integrate a supported application
				   - Remove an application from PieHelper as an integrated application and optionally uninstall it
				   - Configure an integrated application
				   - Move an integrated appplication from it's allocated to a different TTY
				   - Configure an integrated application as the default application to start on system boot 
				   - Detect the presence of any supported applications on your system and integrate them into PieHelper
	* confopts_ph.sh : used to - View and change the value of options of any supported application
				   - View the help for options of any supported application
	* confsupp_ph.sh : used to - Add out-of-scope applications as supported and integrated applications
				   - Remove previously out-of-scope applications from PieHelper as supported and integrated applications and optionally uninstall them
	* confctrl_ph.sh : used to - Display manual configuration steps for different controller types and connection methods
				   - Interactively configure bluetooth controllers
	* confgenb_ph.sh : used to - Generate a new tar build archive, optionally create a timestamped backup and synchronize all changes to the remote github master repository
	* startXXX.sh    : used to - Start an integrated application with shortname XXXX (shortnames are defined as a unique identifier consisting of maximum the 4 first letters of an application name)
				   - On any integrated application start, any other integrated applications marked as non-persistent will first be stopped
				   - The startscript for PieHelper (startpieh.sh) can be launched with the following parameters :
						-p : To start the PieHelper menu on a remote pseudo-terminal instead of it's allocated TTY
	          				     Using this option will prevent other running integrated applications being stopped first with the sole exception of other PieHelper instances running on a TTY
				     		     Starting PieHelper without -p will always stop any instances running on a remote pseudo-terminal
						-m : To start PieHelper in a specific menu or submenu instead of the default Main menu
						-h : To show help
	* stopXXXX.sh    : used to - Stop an integrated application with shortname XXXX
				   - The stopscript for PieHelper (stoppieh.sh) can be launched with the following parameters :
						-p : To stop an instance of PieHelper currently running on a pseudo-terminal instead of it's allocated TTY
						     This option should not be used if PieHelper is running on it's allocated TTY
						-h : To show help
	* restartXXXX.sh : used to - Restart an integrated application with shortname XXXX
	* listmoon_ph.sh : used to - List all shared games for Moonlight
	* listblue_ph.sh : used to - list available bluetooth adapters and the adapter currently configured as default

- The -h parameter for showing help is available for all tools, not just the ones specific to PieHelper
- The PieHelper menu offers most, but not all of the options available with the CLI tools
