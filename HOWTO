- PieHelper works by binding a supported application to a specific TTY
  When switching to a TTY, the application bound to it will autostart
- PieHelper will autodetect a first run and autostart configure method
  Alternatively, running confpieh_ph.sh -c will also start configuration mode for PieHelper
  PieHelper will configure it's menu as the default app to start on system boot during this initial configuration
- After initial configuration, the location for all PieHelper scripts will also be automatically added to your PATH variable
  The PieHelper menu or any available scripts can be used to manage all PieHelper integrated applications or
  to add or remove any additional applications as an integrated application

				   - move an integrated appplication from it's allocated to a different TTY
				   - configure an application as the default application to start on system boot 
				   - detect the presence of any supported applications on your system and integrate them into PieHelper
	* confopts_ph.sh : used to - view and configure option values for any supported application
				   - view the help of any option for any supported application
	* confsupp_ph.sh : used to - add out-of-scope applications as a PieHelper supported and integrated application
				   - remove previously out-of-scope applications as a PieHelper supported and integrated application

	* startXXX.sh    : used to - start an application with shortname XXXX (shortnames are defined as a unique identifier consisting out of the 4 first letters of the application name in lowercase)
				   - On any integrated application start, any other integrated applications marked as non-persistent will first be stopped
				   - startpieh.sh can be launched with a -p parameter if you wish to use the PieHelper menu on a remote pseudo-terminal instead of it's allocated TTY
				     using this option will prevent other running integrated applications being stopped first with the sole exception of other PieHelper instances running on a TTY
				     Starting PieHelper without -p will always stop any instances running on a remote pseudo-terminal
	* stopXXXX.sh    : used to - stop an integrated application with shortname XXXX
	* restartXXXX.sh : used to - restart an integrated application with shortname XXXX
