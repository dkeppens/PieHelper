* support in ph_repair_pieh for protection against multiple instances of 1 app + verification whether all known info matches
* change to one script for each action and use parameters : new branch !
* in interactive set for confopts_ph.sh : display for num_Ctrl and cmd_opts that changes will be reflected to the other
* also for confopts_ph.sh : display notice about using PH_CTRL string when adding EBIDs to CMD_opts
* changes for using CMD_OPTS myself for all apps, also in supported_apps configuration file for all but basic start command + watch special position for graphical stuff in that case
* if start using kodi cmd_opts -> kodi num_ctrl can no longer be read-only + in general impact on way graph appls are handled
* more dynamic linked behaviour between num_ctrl and cmd_opts option valid for all applications
 - num_ctrl not to 0
 - if num_ctrl change -> check cmd_opts for event-based input-devices (EBID) and change to reflect (add on add and remove on remove)
 										if not present, no change to cmd_opts
 - if cmd_opts change -> if EBID are present -> reflect change it not going to 0
								if going to 0, no change to num_ctrl
			if no EBID -> reflect new number after add/remove to num_ctrl
 - with  * check if CMD_OPTS or NUM_CTRL empty, no auto change the corresponding one in ph_set_option

* create button configuration files for the different controller types for emulationstation with configure script
* change confpieh_ph.sh -p debug for partial results and for fasttrack bypass to set all modules to debug/no debug 
* change xboxdrv mapping to xbox controller(s) in ph_setup_controllers for all but PS4 usb to correct mappings 
* occasional cifs mount problem which for Emulationstation remains ?
* check for entered single quotes and report error on them in all interactive prompts for new option values + test what happens on non-interactive ones
* only sed CMD_OPTS vars on startup of app if 'PH_CTRL' string present in current value of CMD_OPTS
* write confoper_ph.sh and check for /proc, systemd and ksh93 prereqs
* no change TTY and stop all other apps on just restart of application ? works for kodi,moonlight,emul stuff too ?
* check for /etc/apt/apt.conf on debian and turn off option don't install recommended packages
* test for controllers actually online
* test listblue_ph.sh with more than one bluetooth adapter
* support for using a mix of different controller types
* test integrated new bluetooth method for newest modelPI -> change ph_setup_controllers if needed
* check clarity of output for ph_generate_installed_apps (dedicate a TTY for prompts)
* rename installed_apps to integrated_apps
* test from menus to see if increase in PH_PIEH_MAX_TTYS viable or not and if so : remove limit check in confsupp_ph.sh + mentions of it everywhere
* test persistence ignored for piehelper when stop issued from menu and revert + also in conf file if non-functional
* test all confxxxx_ph.sh scripts now have all checks needed
* remove all code for move scripts and all move scripts and move template
* check for nowhere empty reads where not permitted
* Get list of necessary paths for PATH (include shells) -> packages required (fi aplay)
* Configure option VRAM for Kodi config gpu_mem_** based on raspberry model
* possibility of using ph_show_menu Main in installed_apps for PieHelper
* move script logic to ph_run_action -> rebuild templates & all scripts
* check and possibly format some more input stuff in functions
* recursive going back to original settings when error occured ala confgenb also in confsupp
* empty line remains in functions.user in confsupp on remove app
* correct code ph_configure_moon for pairing and test Moonlight when GFE back OK
* test controller mappings
* test second controller input
* test fresh install on new model Raspberry
* test emulationstation gaming for a couple successive games
* test ph_install_app and ph_remove_app for Emulationstation and Kodi
* check all conf files for ALL TABS
* test ph_remove_pieh from menus and through confpieh_ph.sh
* test keyboard/mouse functionality on TTYs for Bash and X11
* hashing of passwords functionality
* signal catching where possible
* mention supported controllers in README and mixing controller types not supported
* mention no support for multiple physical displays in README
* test all from menus
* test confsupp_ph.sh for graphical stuff
* test acls for different users

* verify HOWTO
* package version with or without dependencies ? (with could possibly change scripts f.e. required packages no longer needed ?)
* try compiling steam on arm and add it for self-use only if possible
