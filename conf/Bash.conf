# General Bash configuration
# Do NOT edit the configuration files manually. Always use PieHelper to make changes

PH_BASH_PERSISTENT='yes'								# - This indicates whether Bash, when active, should be kept running on it's allocated TTY
											#   whenever any application other than Bash starts
											#   Persistent applications will only stop when a direct stop or restart is issued
											# - Default is 'yes'
											# - Accepted values are 'yes' and 'no'
											# - Important : * If an application does not render to the default frame buffer it can stay visible in foreground when switching to
											#                 a TTY that is allocated to a persistent-marked application
											#               * That behaviour can be avoided by setting persistence to 'no' for both applications
PH_BASH_PKG_NAME='bash'									# - This is the package name for Bash if available
											# - Default is 'bash'
PH_BASH_CMD_OPTS=''									# - These are the command line options you wish to launch Bash with
											# - Amongst others, this can be used for passing event-based input devices when required as parameters by Bash
											#   When passing event-based input devices, replace the numeric id in the device reference with the string 'PH_CTRL%' where
											#   where '%' is '1' for device 1, '2' for device 2, etc
											# - Changes to an option holding an application's command line options where event-based input devices are present will automatically be reflected
											#   to the application's option determining the controller amount unless all event device parameters are being removed
											# - Default is ''
