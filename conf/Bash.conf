# General Bash configuration
# Do NOT edit the configuration files manually. Always use PieHelper to make changes

PH_BASH_PERSISTENT='yes'								# - This indicates whether Bash, when active, should be kept running on it's allocated TTY
											#   whenever any application other than Bash starts
											#   Persistent applications will only stop when a direct stop or restart is issued
											# - Default is 'yes'
											# - Allowed values are 'yes' and 'no'
											# - Important : * If an application does not render to the default frame buffer it can stay visible in foreground when switching to
											#                 a TTY that is allocated to a persistent-marked application
											#               * That behaviour can be avoided by setting persistence to 'no' for both applications
PH_BASH_PKG_NAME='bash'									# - This is the package name for Bash if available
											# - Default is 'bash'
PH_BASH_CMD_OPTS=''									# - These are the command line options you wish to launch Bash with
											# - Amongst others, this can be used for passing event-based input devices when required as parameters by Bash
											#   When passing event-based input devices, replace the numeric id in the device reference with the string 'PH_CTRL%' where
											#   where '%' is '1' for device 1, '2' for device 2, etc
											# - Changes to an option holding an application's command line options where event-based input devices are present will automatically be reflected
											#   to the application's option determining the controller amount unless all event device parameters are being removed
											# - Default is ''
PH_BASH_CIFS_SHARE='no'									# - This indicates whether you want to mount a CIFS share from a local network server PH_BASH_CIFS_SRV before Bash starts and
											#   umount it after Bash shuts down
											# - Default is 'no'
											# - Allowed values are 'yes' and 'no'
											# - Important : * Keep in mind that setting this to 'yes' requires you to enable CIFS sharing on PH_BASH_CIFS_SRV
											#               * You should also make sure your PI has adequate permissions to access that share
											#               * Lastly, a user account PH_BASH_CIFS_USER with a password PH_BASH_CIFS_PASS should be created on PH_BASH_CIFS_SRV
PH_BASH_CIFS_USER=''									# - This is the user account on local network server PH_BASH_CIFS_SRV with password PH_BASH_CIFS_PASS
											#   if PH_BASH_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - Default is ''
PH_BASH_CIFS_PASS=''									# - This is the password for user PH_BASH_CIFS_USER on local network server PH_BASH_CIFS_SRV if PH_BASH_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - The password should not contain any single quote (') characters
											# - Default is ''
PH_BASH_CIFS_SRV=''									# - This is the ip address of your local network server where CIFS sharing is enabled if PH_BASH_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - Default is ''
											# - Allowed values are valid ipv4 addresses and an empty string
PH_BASH_CIFS_DIR=''									# - This is the pathname of the CIFS share on local network server PH_BASH_CIFS_SRV if PH_BASH_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - Default is ''
											# - Allowed values are pathnames (Values starting with '/' or '$') and an empty string
PH_BASH_CIFS_SUBDIR=''									# - This is the pathname relative to PH_BASH_CIFS_DIR on local network server PH_BASH_CIFS_SRV that will be mounted on PH_BASH_CIFS_MPT
											#   if PH_BASH_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - Default is ''
											# - Allowed values are pathnames (Values starting with '/' or '$') and an empty string
PH_BASH_CIFS_MPT='$PH_CONF_DIR/../mnt/Bash'						# - This is the full pathname of a directory on your PI where you want to mount PH_BASH_CIFS_SUBDIR if PH_BASH_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - A default directory named 'mnt' with a subfolder for each integrated application is automatically created under the root of the PieHelper
											#   install location but other values can be set if preferred
											#   If a different value is set, make sure the directory specified is empty
											# - Default is '$PH_CONF_DIR/../mnt/Bash'
											# - Allowed values are pathnames (Values starting with '/' or '$') and an empty string
PH_BASH_PRE_CMD=''									# - This is the full command to run before starting Bash. If PH_BASH_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes', it will be run when the CIFS share is mounted
											#   Make sure the run account used for Bash has adequate permission when customising this
											# - Default is ''
											# - Allowed values are full pathnames (Values starting with '/' or '$') of scripts, sourceable scripts and executables or an empty string
											#   Sourceable scripts can use variable names known to PieHelper
PH_BASH_POST_CMD=''									# - This is the full command to run after stopping Bash. If PH_BASH_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes', it will be run when the CIFS share is mounted
											#   Make sure the run account used for Bash has adequate permissions when customising this
											# - Default is ''
											# - Allowed values are full pathnames (Values starting with '/' or '$') of scripts, sourceable scripts and executables or an empty string
											#   Sourceable scripts can use variable names known to PieHelper
