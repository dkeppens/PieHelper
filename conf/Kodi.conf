# General Kodi configuration
# Do NOT edit the configuration files manually. Always use PieHelper to make changes

# Read-only variables

[[ -z $PH_KODI_PERSISTENT ]] && typeset -r PH_KODI_PERSISTENT='no'			# - This indicates whether Kodi, when active, should be kept running on it's allocated TTY
											#   whenever any application other than Kodi starts
											#   Persistent applications will only stop when a direct stop or restart is issued
											# - Default is 'no'
											# - This value is read-only
											# - Important : * If an application does not render to the default frame buffer it can stay visible in foreground when switching to
											#                 a TTY that is allocated to a persistent-marked application
											#               * That behaviour can be avoided by setting persistence to 'no' for both applications
[[ -z $PH_KODI_NUM_CTRL ]] && typeset -r PH_KODI_NUM_CTRL='1'				# - This is the number of controllers you want to use with Kodi
											# - Changes to an option that sets the controller amount for an application will automatically be reflected to
											#   the application's command line options if event-based input devices are present as command-line parameters
											# - Default is '1'
											# - This value is read-only

# Variables

PH_KODI_PKG_NAME='kodi'									# - This is the package name for Kodi if available
											# - Default is 'kodi'
PH_KODI_USE_CTRL='no'									# - This indicates whether you want to use controllers with Kodi or not
											#   Controller type to be used and the toggle for optional mapping with xboxdrv should be configured separately using confopts_ph.sh
											#   or the PieHelper menu
											# - The amount of controllers to use can be set with option PH_KODI_NUM_CTRL
											# - If this is set to 'yes' and the specified amount of controllers of the type configured can not be detected on Kodi startup,
											#   startup will fail
											# - Default is 'no'
											# - Accepted values are 'yes' and 'no'
