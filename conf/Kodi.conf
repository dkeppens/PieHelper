# General Kodi configuration
# Do NOT edit the configuration files manually. Always use PieHelper to make changes

# Read-only variables

[[ -z "$PH_KODI_PERSISTENT" ]] && typeset -r PH_KODI_PERSISTENT='no'			# - This indicates whether Kodi, when active, should be kept running on it's allocated TTY
											#   whenever any application other than Kodi starts
											#   Persistent applications will only stop when a direct stop or restart is issued
											# - Default is 'no'
											# - This value is read-only
											# - Important : * If an application does not render to the default frame buffer it can stay visible in foreground when switching to
											#                 a TTY that is allocated to a persistent-marked application
											#               * That behaviour can be avoided by setting persistence to 'no' for both applications
[[ -z "$PH_KODI_NUM_CTRL" ]] && typeset -r PH_KODI_NUM_CTRL='1'				# - This is the number of controllers you want to use with Kodi
											# - Changes to an option that sets the controller amount for an application will automatically be reflected to
											#   the application's command line options if event-based input devices are present as command-line parameters
											# - Default is '1'
											# - This value is read-only

# Variables

PH_KODI_PKG_NAME='kodi'									# - This is the package name for Kodi if available
											# - Default is 'kodi'
PH_KODI_USE_CTRL='no'									# - This indicates whether you want to use controllers with Kodi or not
											#   Controller type to be used and the toggle for optional mapping with xboxdrv should be configured separately using 'confopts_ph.sh'
											#   or the PieHelper menu
											# - The amount of controllers to use can be set with option PH_KODI_NUM_CTRL
											# - If this is set to 'yes' and the specified amount of controllers of the type configured can not be detected on Kodi startup,
											#   startup will fail
											# - Default is 'no'
											# - Allowed values are 'yes' and 'no'
PH_KODI_CMD_OPTS=''									# - These are the command line options you want to launch Kodi with
											# - Amongst others, this can be used for passing event-based input devices when required as parameters by Kodi
											#   When passing event-based input devices, replace the numeric id in the device reference with the string 'PH_CTRL%' where
											#   where '%' is '1' for device 1, '2' for device 2, etc
											# - Changes to an option holding an application's command line options where event-based input devices are present will automatically be reflected
											#   to the application's option determining the controller amount unless all event device parameters are being removed
											# - Default is ''
PH_KODI_CIFS_SHARE='no'								# - This indicates whether you want to mount a CIFS share from a local network server PH_KODI_CIFS_SRV before Kodi starts and
											#   umount it after Kodi shuts down
											# - If the run account for Kodi is different from PieHelper's run account, then Kodi's run account should always be granted
											#   read-write permission on the configured CIFS share, even when it is not being used as the value for PH_KODI_CIFS_USER
											# - Default is 'no'
											# - Allowed values are 'yes' and 'no'
											# - Important : * Keep in mind that setting this to 'yes' requires you to enable CIFS sharing on PH_KODI_CIFS_SRV
											#               * You should also make sure your PI has adequate permissions to access that share
											#               * Lastly, a user account PH_KODI_CIFS_USER with a password PH_KODI_CIFS_PASS should be created on PH_KODI_CIFS_SRV
PH_KODI_CIFS_USER=''								# - This is the user account on local network server PH_KODI_CIFS_SRV with password PH_KODI_CIFS_PASS
											#   if PH_KODI_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - Default is ''
PH_KODI_CIFS_PASS=''								# - This is the password for user PH_KODI_CIFS_USER on local network server PH_KODI_CIFS_SRV if PH_KODI_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - The password should not contain any single quote (') characters
											# - Default is ''
PH_KODI_CIFS_SRV=''								# - This is the ip address of your local network server where CIFS sharing is enabled if PH_KODI_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - Default is ''
											# - Allowed values are valid ipv4 addresses and an empty string
PH_KODI_CIFS_DIR=''								# - This is the pathname of the CIFS share on local network server PH_KODI_CIFS_SRV if PH_KODI_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - Default is ''
											# - Allowed values are pathnames (Values starting with '/' or '$') and an empty string
PH_KODI_CIFS_SUBDIR=''							# - This is the pathname relative to PH_KODI_CIFS_DIR on local network server PH_KODI_CIFS_SRV that will be mounted on PH_KODI_CIFS_MPT
											#   if PH_KODI_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - Default is ''
											# - Allowed values are pathnames (Values starting with '/' or '$') and an empty string
PH_KODI_CIFS_MPT='$PH_CONF_DIR/../mnt/Kodi'						# - This is the full pathname of a directory on your PI where you want to mount PH_KODI_CIFS_SUBDIR if PH_KODI_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - A default directory named 'mnt' with a subfolder for each integrated application is automatically created under the root of the PieHelper
											#   install location but other values can be set if preferred
											#   If a different value is set, make sure the directory specified is empty
											# - Default is '$PH_CONF_DIR/../mnt/Kodi'
											# - Allowed values are pathnames (Values starting with '/' or '$') and an empty string
PH_KODI_PRE_CMD='$PH_SCRIPTS_DIR/../pre_cmds/Kodi-PRE.sh'				# - This is the full command to run before starting Kodi. If PH_KODI_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes', it will be run when the CIFS share is mounted
											#   Make sure the run account used for Kodi has adequate permission when customising this
											# - PRE-commands that fail will only generate a warning and not block further Kodi startup
											# - Default is '$PH_SCRIPTS_DIR/../pre_cmds/Kodi-PRE.sh' which will restore kodi preferences directory for Kodi's run account from
											#   '$PH_KODI_CIFS_MPT/Kodi-Prefs.tar' if PH_KODI_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											#   Note that this will delay Kodi startup
											# - Allowed values are full pathnames (Values starting with '/' or '$') of scripts, sourceable scripts and executables or an empty string
											#   Sourceable scripts can use variable names known to PieHelper
PH_KODI_POST_CMD='$PH_SCRIPTS_DIR/../post_cmds/Kodi-POST.sh'				# - This is the full command to run after stopping Kodi. If PH_KODI_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes', it will be run when the CIFS share is mounted
											#   Make sure the run account used for Kodi has adequate permissions when customising this
											# - POST-commands that fail will only generate a warning
											# - Default is '$PH_SCRIPTS_DIR/../post_cmds/Kodi-POST.sh' which will backup the kodi preferences directory for Kodi's run account to
											#   '$PH_KODI_CIFS_MPT/Kodi-Prefs.tar' if PH_KODI_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											#   Note that this will delay Kodi shutdown
											# - Allowed values are full pathnames (Values starting with '/' or '$') of scripts, sourceable scripts and executables or an empty string
											#   Sourceable scripts can use variable names known to PieHelper
