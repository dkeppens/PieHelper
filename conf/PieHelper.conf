# General PieHelper configuration
# Do NOT edit the configuration files manually. Always use PieHelper to make changes

# Read-only variables

[[ -z $PH_PIEH_MAX_TTYS ]] && typeset -i -r PH_PIEH_MAX_TTYS=12				# - This specifies the highest TTY number allocatable to applications
											# - Default is '12'
											# - This value is read-only

# Variables

PH_PIEH_PERSISTENT='no'								# - This indicates whether PieHelper, when active, should be kept running on it's allocated TTY
											#   whenever any application other than PieHelper starts
											#   Persistent applications will only stop when a direct stop or restart is issued
											# - Default is 'yes'
											# - Accepted values are 'yes' and 'no'
											# - Important : * If an application does not render to the default frame buffer it can stay visible in foreground when switching to
											#                 a TTY that is allocated to a persistent-marked application
											#               * That behaviour can be avoided by setting persistence to 'no' for both applications
											#               * For that reason, persistence set to 'yes' will be ignored for PieHelper when it's running on it's allocated TTY
											#                 It will still be taken into account when PieHelper is running on a pseudo-terminal
PH_PIEH_DEBUG=''									# - This is a comma-separated list of PieHelper modules to run with xtrace (debug) enabled
											# - Default is ''
											# - Accepted values are any relevant PieHelper modules
											# - Relevant module names are defined as all PieHelper script names and any PieHelper functions relevant to the Operating system being used
PH_PIEH_STARTAPP='PieHelper'									# - This is the application that is configured to start on system boot
											# - Default is 'none'
											# - Accepted values are 'none' and names of applications currently integrated with PieHelper
PH_PIEH_CMD_OPTS='Main'									# - These are the command line options you want to launch PieHelper with and the specific menu you wish PieHelper to start in
											# - Amongst others, this can be used for passing event-based input devices when required as parameters by PieHelper
											#   When passing event-based input devices, replace the numeric id in the device reference with the string 'PH_CTRL%' where
											#   where '%' is '1' for device 1, '2' for device 2, etc
											# - Changes to an option for an application's command line options where event-based input devices are present will automatically be reflected to
											#   the application's option determining the controller amount unless all event device parameters are being removed
											# - Default is 'Main'
PH_PIEH_CIFS_SHARE='no'								# - This indicates whether you want to create a timestamped backup of each new PieHelper tarball generated by
											#   'confgenb_ph.sh' on network server PH_PIEH_CIFS_SRV using CIFS
											# - Default is 'no'
											# - Accepted values are 'yes' and 'no'
											# - Important : * Keep in mind that setting this to 'yes' requires you to enable CIFS sharing on PH_PIEH_CIFS_SRV
											#               * You should also make sure your PI has adequate permissions to access that share
											#               * Lastly, a user account PH_PIEH_CIFS_USER with a password PH_PIEH_CIFS_PASS should be created on PH_PIEH_CIFS_SRV
PH_PIEH_CIFS_USER=''								# - This is the user account that should be present on local network server PH_PIEH_CIFS_SRV with password PH_PIEH_CIFS_USER
											#   if PH_PIEH_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - Default is ''
PH_PIEH_CIFS_PASS=''								# - This is the password for user PH_PIEH_CIFS_USER on local network server PH_PIEH_CIFS_SRV if PH_PIEH_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - The password should not contain any single quote (') characters
											# - Default is ''
PH_PIEH_CIFS_SRV=''								# - This is the IP address of the local network server where you want to backup PieHelper build archives to using CIFS if
											#   PH_PIEH_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - Default is ''
											# - Accepted values are valid ipv4 addresses and an empty string
PH_PIEH_CIFS_DIR=''								# - This is the shared CIFS directory on local network server PH_PIEH_CIFS_SRV if PH_PIEH_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - Default is ''
											# - Accepted values are pathnames (Values starting with '/') and empty
PH_PIEH_CIFS_SUBDIR=''						# - This is the relative path to CIFS shared directory PH_PIEH_CIFS_DIR on local network server PH_PIEH_CIFS_SRV
											#   where you want to backup PieHelper build archives to if PH_PIEH_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - Default is ''
											# - Accepted values are pathnames (Values starting with '/') and empty
