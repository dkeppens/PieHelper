# General PieHelper configuration
# Do NOT edit the configuration files manually. Always use PieHelper to make changes

# Read-only variables

[[ -z $PH_PIEH_MAX_TTYS ]] && typeset -r PH_PIEH_MAX_TTYS=12				# - This specifies the highest TTY number allocatable to applications
											# - Default is '12'
											# - This value is read-only
[[ -z "$PH_PIEH_USE_CTRL" ]] && typeset -r PH_PIEH_USE_CTRL='no'			# - This indicates whether you want to use controllers with PieHelper or not
											# - Controller type to be used and the toggle for optional mapping with xboxdrv should be configured separately using 'confopts_ph.sh'
											#   or the PieHelper menu
											# - The amount of controllers to use can be set with option PH_PIEH_NUM_CTRL
											# - If this is set to 'yes' and the specified amount of controllers of the type configured can not be detected on PieHelper startup,
											#   startup will fail
											# - Default is 'no'
											# - This value is read-only
[[ -z "$PH_PIEH_NUM_CTRL" ]] && typeset -r PH_PIEH_NUM_CTRL='1'				# - This is the number of controllers you want to use with PieHelper
											# - Changes to an option that sets the controller amount for an application will automatically be reflected to
											#   the option holding that application's command line options if event-based input devices are present as command-line parameters
											# - Default is '1'
											# - This value is read-only

# Variables

PH_PIEH_PERSISTENT='yes'								# - This indicates whether PieHelper, when active, should be kept running, either on it's allocated TTY or it's pseudo-terminal
											#   whenever any application other than PieHelper starts
											#   Persistent applications will only stop when a direct stop or restart is issued
											# - Any time PieHelper is started on it's allocated TTY, PH_PIEH_PERSISTENT will be set to 'yes'
											# - Any time a start operation for any other application than PieHelper fully completes, PieHelper will terminate if running on it's TTY
											# - Default is 'yes'
											# - Allowed values are 'yes' and 'no'
											# - Important : * If an application does not render to the default frame buffer it can stay visible in foreground when switching to
											#                 a TTY that is allocated to a persistent-marked application
											#               * That behaviour can be avoided by setting persistence to 'no' for both applications
PH_PIEH_DEBUG=''									# - This is a comma-separated list of PieHelper modules to run with xtrace (debug) enabled
											# - Default is ''
											# - Allowed values are any relevant PieHelper modules
											# - Relevant module names are defined as all PieHelper script names and any PieHelper functions relevant to the Operating system being used
PH_PIEH_STARTAPP='none'									# - This is the application that is configured to start on system boot
											# - Default is 'none'
											# - Allowed values are 'none' and names of applications currently integrated with PieHelper
PH_PIEH_CMD_OPTS='Main'									# - These are the command line options you want to launch PieHelper with and the specific menu you wish PieHelper to start in
											# - Amongst others, this can be used for passing event-based input devices when required as parameters by PieHelper
											#   When passing event-based input devices, replace the numeric id in the device reference with the string 'PH_CTRL%' where
											#   where '%' is '1' for device 1, '2' for device 2, etc
											# - Changes to an option for an application's command line options where event-based input devices are present will automatically be reflected to
											#   the application's option determining the controller amount unless all event device parameters are being removed
											# - Default is 'Main'
											# - Allowed values are 'Main', 'Controllers', 'Apps', 'Advanced', 'Settings', 'PS3', 'PS4', 'XBOX360', 'AppManagement',
											#   'OptsManagement', 'TTYManagement', the name of any supported application, as well as both 'OptsManagement' and 'TTYManagement' concatenated
											#   with '_' and the name of any supported application, f.e. 'OptsManagement_Bash' or 'TTYManagement_Moonlight'
PH_PIEH_PKG_NAME=''									# - This is the package name for PieHelper if available
											# - Default is ''
PH_PIEH_CIFS_SHARE='no'									# - This indicates whether you want to mount a CIFS share from a local network server PH_PIEH_CIFS_SRV before PieHelper starts and
											#   umount it after PieHelper shuts down
											#   A value of 'yes' will be ignored when starting or stopping PieHelper on a pseudo-terminal
											# - Additionally, this also determines whether you want to make a timestamped backup copy of any build archive generated
											#   by 'confgenb_ph.sh'
											# - Default is 'no'
											# - Allowed values are 'yes' and 'no'
											# - Important : * Keep in mind that setting this to 'yes' requires you to enable CIFS sharing on PH_PIEH_CIFS_SRV
											#               * You should also make sure your PI has adequate permissions to access that share
											#               * Enable UNIX permissions functionality on your CIFS server if available
											#               * Lastly, a user account PH_PIEH_CIFS_USER with a password PH_PIEH_CIFS_PASS should be created on PH_PIEH_CIFS_SRV
											#               * Check PH_PIEH_CIFS_USER help for more information on specific rules applicable to PH_PIEH_CIFS_USER values
PH_PIEH_CIFS_USER=''									# - This is the user account on local network server PH_PIEH_CIFS_SRV with password PH_PIEH_CIFS_PASS
											#   if PH_PIEH_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - If the run account for PieHelper is different from PH_PIEH_CIFS_USER's value and not 'root', then PieHelper's run account should always be
											#   created on PH_PIEH_CIFS_SRV and granted read-write permissions to the share
											# - This account should be granted read-write permission to the configured share on PH_PIEH_CIFS_SRV
											# - Default is ''
											# - Allowed values are locally existing accounts and an empty string
PH_PIEH_CIFS_PASS=''								# - This is the password for user PH_PIEH_CIFS_USER on local network server PH_PIEH_CIFS_SRV if PH_PIEH_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - The password should not contain any single quote (') characters
											# - Default is ''
PH_PIEH_CIFS_SRV=''								# - This is the ip address of your local network server where CIFS sharing is enabled if PH_PIEH_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - Default is ''
											# - Allowed values are valid ipv4 addresses and an empty string
PH_PIEH_CIFS_DIR=''								# - This is the pathname of the CIFS share on local network server PH_PIEH_CIFS_SRV if PH_PIEH_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - Default is ''
											# - Allowed values are pathnames (Values starting with '/' or '$') and an empty string
PH_PIEH_CIFS_SUBDIR=''					# - This is the pathname relative to PH_PIEH_CIFS_DIR on local network server PH_PIEH_CIFS_SRV that will be mounted on PH_PIEH_CIFS_MPT
											#   if PH_PIEH_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - Additionally, for PieHelper, this is also the location where timestamped backup copies of your build archives will be stored
											# - Default is ''
											# - Allowed values are pathnames (Values starting with '/' or '$') and an empty string
PH_PIEH_CIFS_MPT='$PH_CONF_DIR/../mnt/PieHelper'					# - This is the full pathname of a directory on your PI where you want to mount PH_PIEH_CIFS_SUBDIR if PH_PIEH_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - A default directory named 'mnt' with a subfolder for each integrated application is automatically created under the root of the PieHelper
											#   install location but other values can be set if preferred
											#   If a different value is set, make sure the directory specified is empty
											# - Default is '$PH_CONF_DIR/../mnt/PieHelper'
											# - Allowed values are pathnames (Values starting with '/' or '$') and an empty string
PH_PIEH_PRE_CMD='$PH_SCRIPTS_DIR/../pre_cmds/PieHelper-PRE.sh'				# - This is the full command to run before starting PieHelper
											#   Make sure the run account used for PieHelper has adequate permission to execute when customizing this
											# - PRE-commands that fail will only generate a warning and not block further PieHelper startup
											# - Default is '$PH_SCRIPTS_DIR/../pre_cmds/PieHelper-PRE.sh' which will restore a backup copy of the 'OS.defaults' file,
											#   which stores all previously configured default values for OS configuration functions,
											#   from PH_PIEH_CIFS_SUBDIR on PH_PIEH_CIFS_SRV if one is found and CIFS for PieHelper is correctly configured
											# - Allowed values are full pathnames (Values starting with '/' or '$') of scripts, sourceable scripts and executables or an empty string
											#   Sourceable scripts can use variable names known to PieHelper
PH_PIEH_POST_CMD='$PH_SCRIPTS_DIR/../post_cmds/PieHelper-POST.sh'			# - This is the full command to run after stopping PieHelper
											#   Make sure the run account used for PieHelper has adequate permission to execute when customizing this
											# - POST-commands that fail will only generate a warning
											# - Default is '$PH_SCRIPTS_DIR/../post_cmds/PieHelper-POST.sh' which will create a backup copy of the 'OS.defaults' file,
											#   which stores all previously configured default values for OS configuration functions,
											#   in PH_PIEH_CIFS_SUBDIR on PH_PIEH_CIFS_SRV if any configured defaults are found and CIFS for PieHelper is correctly configured
											# - Allowed values are full pathnames (Values starting with '/' or '$') of scripts, sourceable scripts and executables or an empty string
