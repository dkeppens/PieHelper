# General Controller configuration
# Do NOT edit the configuration files manually. Always use PieHelper to make changes

PH_CTRL_TYPE='PS4'									# - This is the controller type PieHelper will scan for when starting applications which have controller usage set to 'yes'
											# - If PieHelper cannot succesfully detect at least the amount of controllers of type PH_CTRL_TYPE determined by
											#   option PH_APP_NUM_CTRL where 'APP' is the shortname of the application in question, startup will fail
											# - PieHelper does not configure controllers :
											#   * Make sure your controller(s) are configured on the operating system before launching an application for which
											#     controller usage is set to 'yes'
											#   * General tips on how to configure several controller types can be gotten from confctrl_ph.sh or in the PieHelper menu
											# - Default is 'PS4'
											# - Accepted values are 'PS4', 'PS3' and 'XBOX'
PH_CTRL_MAP='no'									# - This specifies whether you want controllers of type PH_CTRL_TYPE mapped to XBOX360 Wireless controllers using xboxdrv
											#   (XBOX 360 Wireless controller emulation)
											#   Games or applications lacking native support for Playstation controllers will require setting this to 'yes'
											# - A value of 'yes' will be ignored if PH_CTRL_TYPE is set to 'XBOX'
											# - Default is 'no'
											# - Accepted values are 'yes' and 'no'
