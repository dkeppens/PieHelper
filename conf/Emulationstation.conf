# General Emulationstation/RetroArch configuration
# Do NOT edit the configuration files manually. Always use PieHelper to make changes

# Read-only variables

[[ -z $PH_EMUL_PERSISTENT ]] && typeset -r PH_EMUL_PERSISTENT='no'			# - This indicates whether Emulationstation, when active, should be kept running on it's allocated TTY
											#   whenever any application other than Emulationstation starts
											#   Persistent applications will only stop when a direct stop or restart is issued
											# - Default is 'no'
											# - This value is read-only
											# - Important : * If an application does not render to the default frame buffer it can stay visible in foreground when switching to
											#                 a TTY that is allocated to a persistent-marked application
											#               * That behaviour can be avoided by setting persistence to 'no' for both applications

# Variables

PH_EMUL_PKG_NAME=''									# - This is the package name for Emulationstation if available
											# - Default is ''
PH_EMUL_DIR=''								# - This is the full pathname of the base directory of your Emulationstation installation
											# - The base directory contains all shared libraries under ./libretrocores and is usually /opt/retropie
											# - Default is ''
											# - Accepted values are pathnames (Values starting with '/') and empty
											# - As with PH_EMUL_SETUP_DIR, PieHelper will attempt to autodetect and set this
											#   Only set this manually if that attempt fails and this value remains empty after installing Emulationstation
PH_EMUL_SETUP_DIR=''						# - This is the full pathname of the parent directory of your Emulationstation setup directory, followed by '/RetroPie'
											#   The home directory of the run account for Emulationstation is the recommended value for the parent directory
											# - Default is ''
											# - Accepted values are pathnames (Values starting with '/') and empty
											# - As with PH_EMUL_DIR, PieHelper will attempt to autodetect and set this
											#   Only set this manually if that attempt fails and this value remains empty after installing Emulationstation 
PH_EMUL_USE_CTRL='yes'									# - This indicates whether you want to use controllers with Emulationstation or not
											# - Controller type to be used and the toggle for optional mapping with xboxdrv should be configured separately using confopts_ph.sh
											#   or the PieHelper menu
											# - The amount of controllers to use can be set with option PH_EMUL_NUM_CTRL
											# - If this is set to 'yes' and the specified amount of controllers of the type configured can not be detected on Emulationstation startup,
											#   startup will fail
											# - Default is 'yes'
											# - Accepted values are 'yes' and 'no'
PH_EMUL_NUM_CTRL='1'									# - This is the number of controllers you want to use with Emulationstation
											# - Changes to an option that sets the controller amount for an application will automatically be reflected to
											#   the option holding that application's command line options if event-based input devices are present as command-line parameters
											# - Default is '1'
											# - Accepted values are '1', '2', '3' and '4'
PH_EMUL_CIFS_SHARE='no'								# - This indicates whether you want to mount a CIFS share from a local network server PH_EMU_CIFS_SRV to provide your game roms
											#   to Emulationstation
											# - Default is 'no'
											# - Important : * Keep in mind that setting this to 'yes' requires you to enable CIFS sharing on PH_PIEH_CIFS_SRV
											#               * You should also make sure your PI has adequate permissions to access that share
											#               * Lastly, a user account PH_PIEH_CIFS_USER with a password PH_PIEH_CIFS_PASS should be created on PH_PIEH_CIFS_SRV
PH_EMUL_CIFS_USER=''								# - This is the user account that should be present on local network server PH_EMUL_CIFS_SRV with password PH_EMUL_CIFS_PASS
											#   if PH_EMUL_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - Default is ''
PH_EMUL_CIFS_PASS=''								# - This is the password for user PH_EMUL_CIFS_USER on local network server PH_EMUL_CIFS_SRV if PH_EMUL_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - The password should not contain any single quote (') characters 
											# - Default is ''
PH_EMUL_CIFS_SRV=''								# - This is the ip address of your local network server where you have CIFS sharing enabled if PH_EMUL_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - Default is ''
											# - Accepted values are valid ipv4 addresses and an empty string
PH_EMUL_CIFS_DIR=''								# - This is the pathname of the shared CIFS directory on local network server PH_EMUL_CIFS_SRV if PH_EMUL_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											# - Default is ''
											# - Accepted values are pathnames (Values starting with '/') and empty
PH_EMUL_CIFS_SUBDIR=''							# - This is the relative path to PH_EMUL_CIFS_DIR on local network server PH_EMUL_CIFS_SRV if PH_EMUL_CIFS_SHARE is set to 'yes'
											#   and the location that holds your game roms
											# - Default is ''
											# - Accepted values are pathnames (Values starting with '/') and empty
											# - Important : * The directory specified by PH_EMUL_CIFS_SUBDIR should have the directory structure Emulationstation expects :
											#                 One directory per emulator, named after that emulator. e.g. nes, snes, etc...
											#               * The rom files should be stored in their appropriate emulator's directory
